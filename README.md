# C++ Programming Basics

**Topic: Conditional Statements & Coordinate Geometry**

This section contains basic C++ programs using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to make decisions based on user input. These are part of **Experiment 3A, 3B, and 3C** for the EnTC-A1 batch.

### ✅ Experiment 3A: Number Classification

**Aim:**
To write a C++ program that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

**Theory:**
Conditional statements help us decide what action to take based on different conditions.

* `if` is used when the condition is true.
* `else if` checks another condition if the first is false.
* `else` runs when no other condition is true.

In this program, we use these statements to check if the number is greater than, less than, or equal to zero.

**Conclusion:**
The program worked correctly and identified whether the number was positive, negative, or zero. It helped understand how to use simple condition checks in C++.

### ✅ Experiment 3B: Student Grade Calculator

**Aim:**
To write a C++ program that calculates the average of 5 subject marks and assigns a grade.

**Theory:**
This program uses:

1. Arithmetic to calculate the average.
2. Conditional statements to assign a grade based on the average:

   * O Grade: Outstanding
   * A+, A, B+, B, C Grades
   * Fail if below pass marks

Grades are decided using `if-else if-else` statements arranged from highest to lowest range.

**Conclusion:**
The grade calculator worked as expected and assigned the correct grade. This experiment showed how we can combine arithmetic and conditionals for real-world logic like grading systems.

### ✅ Experiment 3C: Quadrant Identifier

**Aim:**
To write a C++ program that identifies the quadrant of a point (x, y), or checks if it's on an axis or the origin.

**Theory:**
In a 2D plane:

* 1st Quadrant: x > 0, y > 0
* 2nd Quadrant: x < 0, y > 0
* 3rd Quadrant: x < 0, y < 0
* 4th Quadrant: x > 0, y < 0
* Origin: x = 0 and y = 0
* On X-axis: y = 0
* On Y-axis: x = 0

The program uses `if-else if-else` statements with logical operators like `&&` (AND) to check each condition one by one.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly identified the location of the point. It showed how conditionals and logical operators can solve geometry-based problems in C++.
